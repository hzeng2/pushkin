# Lexical decision template

To install this experiment template, use the command `pushkin install experiment`, then select **lexical**.

### config.js

When **correctiveFeedback** is set to true, the bounding box will change color to indicate correctness - green meaning correct, and red meaning incorrect. If set to false, the box remains black.
